 In addition to the terms and conditions in the applicable sections of the Master Service Agreement, the following additional terms and conditions of the Guard Encryption® Service Agreement (collectively, the “Agreement”) shall apply to the Guard Encryption® Service (as defined below).
1. Description of Service.
 a. For Subscribing Users of Guard Encryption Service. Network Solutions is providing current subscribers of the Guard Encryption Service with software and/or other services that provide the ability to encrypt and decrypt electronic messages and attachments thereto ("Guard Encryption Service").
b. For Non-Subscribing Recipients and Users of Guard Encryption Service. Network Solutions is providing non- subscribing recipients and users with access to the Guard Encryption Service to decrypt messages from current Guard Encryption Service subscribers and allow non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service recipients and users to encrypt a limited response (non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service users will not be able to send an encrypted response to any email address not included in the original encrypted message, nor will the non- subscribing Guard Encryption Service user be able to include an attachment to the encrypted response). The non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service recipient’s and user's ability to use the Guard Encryption Service is
 conditioned upon the non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service user having Internet web access and the ability to support specific secure web sessions including, but not limited to, a compatible Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
c. Equipment and Compatibility Requirements. You must: (a) provide all necessary compatible equipment and software including, but not limited to, equipment and software that supports a compatible electronic mail service; and (b) provide for your own connection to the Internet and pay any service fees associated with such connection.
d. Further Access and Usage Limits. Network Solutions, at any time and in its sole discretion, may restrict or modify: (a) the size of an electronic message that the Guard Encryption Service will encrypt or decrypt; and (b) the number of recipient decryptions (i.e., the number of times a recipient decrypts your encrypted message) for the messages you encrypt with the Guard Encryption Service in a given time period. Network Solutions, at any time and in its sole discretion, may further restrict or modify the Guard Encryption Service's ability to encrypt and decrypt messages in order to maintain the quality of our services and to protect our computer systems. Network Solutions, in its sole discretion, will determine whether or not your use of the Guard Encryption Service is consistent with this Agreement and any Network Solutions operating rules or policies, and may suspend or terminate your access to the Guard Encryption Service if your usage is found to be inconsistent with this Agreement or such rules or policies.
